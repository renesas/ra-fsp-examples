1. Project Overview:

	The example project demonstrates the use of the FreeRTOS + TCP Module with Ethernet. The example project
   	demonstrate the usage of FreeRTOS DHCP Client, DNS Client and ICMP code. This Example Project has 2 modes for the user
	1)DHCP Mode, where the IP credentials are obtained from the DHCP Server on the Network.
	2)Static IP Address mode, where in the Static IP address can be configured for the Ethernet based on the Availbilty of 
	  free address in the LAN. 
  	
NOTE  : User is expected to enter the static IP address according to the network settings of the LAN.
        In case of DHCP, User just needs to run the application and DHCP client will communicate to the DHCP server and gets the IP address.

2. Configuration Settings:
		
NOTE  : While running the application using DHCP or Static Address mode, the following settings needs to be done in the configurator. 
      : The same projects can be used for both the settings.

1) Segger RTT block address may be needed to download and observe EP operation using a hex file with RTT-Viewer.
   RTT Block address for hex file committed in repository are as follows:
   a. e2studio: 0x2000211c
   b. Keil:	0x200035d8
   c. IAR: 0x200113c8
 
2) If an EP is modified, compiled, and downloaded please find the block address (for the variable in RAM called _SEGGER_RTT) 
   in .map file generated in the build configuration folder (Debug/Release).

NOTE  : On RA MCUs with TrustZone, IDAU boundaries are programmed by this project due to the use of Ethernet and EDMAC peripherals.
        Consequentially, it is necessary to connect the serial programming interface to meet this requirement.
