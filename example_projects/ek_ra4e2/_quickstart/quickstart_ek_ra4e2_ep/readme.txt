1. Project Overview:
        The example project demonstrates some of the capabilities of the EK and FSP by using multiple peripherals.
        The project initializes the USB,ADC and GPIO modules with control via a USB Comm Device class terminal.
        Once programmed the user can control the board by button presses on the board and see regularly updated board 
        configuration on the kit information screen.

2. Hardware settings for the project:
        Please configure the Jumper settings as described in the Quick Start Guide.

3. Configuration Settings:
        Please explore the configuration settings of each module in the RA configurator.
