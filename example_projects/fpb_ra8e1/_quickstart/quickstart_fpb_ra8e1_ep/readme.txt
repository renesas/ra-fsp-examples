1. Project Overview:
        The example project demonstrates some of the capabilities of the FPB and FSP by using multiple peripherals.
        The project initializes the IRQ and GPIO modules and uses SW1 to control the flashing frequency of the User LEDs.
        Once programmed the user can control the board by button presses on device.
